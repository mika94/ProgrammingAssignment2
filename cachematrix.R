## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## The following functions are used to calculate and then cache the inverse of a matrix so that the next time the inverse is used, it is taken out of the cache rather than computed repeatedly.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
